This dockerfile creates a local build & development environment for working with C++, Go, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript
and/or Rust projects.

This image is intended to be built once and the used interactively to work on other projects. The access to project
files is intended to be done primarily through volumes (shared folders) between the host system and the image. This
image does not include IDEs - these should be ran natively on the host operating system.

Note that with all these toolchains in the container, the image is enormous - do *not* use it as a base image to
distribute your applications.

The idea to create and share this image arose from the frustration with the typical Windows-based development
environments where some languages require users to jump through hoops to get the basic functionality to work. Some
languages included in this image have decent-to-very-good developer setup experience, but they were added anyway for
convenience of having all the tools in one spot.

Solutions such as https://www.vagrantup.com[Vagrant] or https://nixos.org/[Nix] can be used to achieve similar
results, but a plain container seems to require the least amount of setup.

== Building

Use this command:

[source,shell]
----
[host$] docker build  .  -f LocalDevEnv.dockerfile  -t local-dev-env:latest
----

Note that it is often a good idea to replace the tag `latest` with the current date to minimize any accidental tool
breakage when upgrading and/or experimenting.

== Usage

This image is intended to be used interactively, with an expectation that the source code of your application will be
mounted via volumes.

The typical usage of this image would be:

[source,shell]
----
[host$] docker run -it --rm  -v /path/to/your/project/files:/media/  local-dev-env:latest
[container$] pwd
[container$] ls -lah  /home/builder  /media
[container$] gcc --version
[container$] clang-16 --version
[container$] cmake --version
[container$] mvn --version
[container$] cargo --version
----

Note that cache directories like `$HOME/.m2` can be mounted in the container image as well - doing so will decrease
ephemeral storage usage and speed up the build.

=== Notes for Windows hosts

NOTE: The MinGW shell distributed with https://git-scm.com/[Git for Windows] performs path mangling. It can be
disabled by setting the `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` environment variable, but it is usually more convenient to run the
`docker` command with volume mounts from a standard `cmd.exe` shell.

Recent versions of Windows are pretty memory-hungry, especially with corporate software running in the background. It
is recommended to fine-tune WSL2 settings before using docker containers for building applications - the easiest way
to do it is by adding `.wslconfig` file in your home directory and restarting WSL (`wsl --shutdown` etc.).

Here's an example of the `C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\.wslconfig`:

[source,ini]
----
# Docs: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config

[wsl2]
swap=0

## You can customize WSL2 further through these two:
# processors=6
# memory=8GB

[experimental]
autoMemoryReclaim=gradual
sparseVhd=true

Also, to save you a click:

* The docker volume mounting syntax on Windows hosts is:
+
[source,shell]
----
[host cmd.exe$] docker run -it --rm  -v D:\path\to\your\project\files:/media  local-dev-env:latest
----
+
* The `:ro` at the end of the volume mount argument will make the files read only:
+
[source,shell]
----
[host cmd.exe$] docker run -it --rm  -v C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\.gnupg:/home/builder/.gnupg:ro  local-dev-env:latest
----
+
* The `^` character can be used to continue the command into the next line, similarly to how the `\` character
functions in Bash:
+
[source,shell]
----
[host cmd.exe$] docker run ^
                       -it --rm  ^
                       -v C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\.gitconfig:/home/builder/.gitconfig:ro  ^
                       -v C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\.gnupg\:/home/builder/.gnupg/:ro  ^
                       -v C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\.ssh\:/home/builder/.ssh/:ro  ^
                       -v C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\.m2\:/home/builder/.m2/  ^
                       -v D:\path\to\your\project\files\:/media/  ^
                       local-dev-env:latest
